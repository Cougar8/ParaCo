<h3><p>I don't quite have a logo yet but feel free to send me your ideas at the email listed in the home page.
I was thinking a simple design with a small paracord weave(square-knot?) to the right of it but as always I am open to suggestions.
Also, What are your logo and how did you come up with them? Were they made by some online logo designer, did you draw
them out, etc. but I just want to learn from you guys.</p></h3>
