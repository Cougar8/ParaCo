<h2 align="left">Background</h2>
<h3><p>ParaCo is a paracord company that started fall 2015 as a fundraiser for CMA, a small school in Tulsa.
This very small company consisted of a group of four people, but with their efforts they managed to raise over $500.
Now most of them are still in contact but the group has sort of split apart as they all went to different schools and only one stayed.</p>
<p>They became Each part of there own company, some of them had skyrocketing business, some their business failing after they left.
Finally, one downgraded his paracord business to a side job, and is learning to become a coder,
and that coder is me. I am indeed a lost member of this company, losing business as I go, and in need of help to keep going.</p></h3>

<h2>The Actual Paracord</h2>
<h3><p>As for the important part, where the paracord comes from. I get my paracord from a website called Paracord Planet that offers
many sweet designs and sets for a slightly more expensive cost than Ebay would sell them. I have bought one of their sets and enjoyed
it, although all the other money I've made came from selling bracelets made from my friend's paracord(rightfully bought from him).
Here is a link to both <a href="http://www.paracordplanet.com/" target="_blank">Paracord Planet</a> and the <a href="http://www.paracordplanet.com/paracord-buckles-combo-kit-zombie/" target="_blank">Zombie Kit</a> that I got.</p></h3>
<h2>Why I Am Doing This</h2>
<h3><p>You may notice I am not advertising even though my business is going down, but I want help in another form. I would appreciate it if all
you who do sell paracord could help improve what I am currently doing. What I do so far is sell in person, custom fit it to the person, and
let them choose the colors of both the paracord and the buckle. Now I know that give only three sizes with specialized colors already assumed
would make it easier and able to be done online, but I want to stay a little more one-on-one. So if you could provide a better way to improve
both the easy access to buy my bracelets and other stuff like better paracord sources or the ordering online method I will take that into consideration.
Also, as paracord makers yourself, what method do you use?</p></h3>
