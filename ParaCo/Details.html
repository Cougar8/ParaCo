<h2>Details</h2>
<h3><p>So, to list the details about what I do. First of all I only sell in person and have no way of contact to potential buyers online.
Basically, the way they find out is either I go around asking them if the want one, or, what happens to me sometimes is they'll see mine
and ask me where I got it so then I respond that I made it. To order they just tell me what colors they want, and then I size their wrist and make it.
They are relatively cheap($5) and they are custom colors and size so I've never gotten any complaints for the two years I've been doing this.</p></h3>
